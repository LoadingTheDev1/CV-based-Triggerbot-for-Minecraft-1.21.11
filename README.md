Computer Vision based triggerbot for minecraft 1.21.11.
To use it:
1. Set the mod up (I use feather client you just put the mod in there but you can also use the regular launcher w fabric too)
2. Launch the game and run the finder script. It should print out 2 values for both the crit and the hit indicator.
3. Plug the offset values into the triggerbot script and run.
   --Important--
   Make sure you're not using fullscreen because then the script can't find the pixels.
   To play windowed borderless i can recommend borderless gaming (It's the one i use)
   This script is totally made for educational purposes and using it for any competitive game is STRICLY forbidden.
I gave up cause it was too hard and kinda boring lol.
If anyone can adjust the script and add new features or perfect it it'd be awesome. (Would be really cool if u shared it w me too)
